Portland Transit Navigator
======================

This project started as a result of living in the South Waterfront neighborhood of Portland, and taking the NS line of the streetcar nearly every day to work for over a year.  Being originally from Los Angeles, which has horrible public transit infrastructure, I've loved experiencing what Portland has to offer in this regard.  There are quite a few good applications out there to help people plan transit trips in Portland, but being a developer, naturally I had to create my own utilizing the Trimet Transit API.

I've since moved out of the service area of the Max or the Portland Streetcar, but I still continue to work on this in the interest of keeping my Javascript skills sharp, and to further my love for mapping & visualizations.
